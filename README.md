Roland-Michel Barrin de La Galissonière, the Marquis de La Galissonière, was governor of New France from 1747 to 1749.

The Huntington Library's archive contains boxes of the governor's letters, some of which are encoded.  The cipher was also found.  There are over 300 coded words and vowel/consonant syllable combinations in this [polygraphic substitution cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygraphic_substitution).  This project was created to facilitate the decoding of the governor's letters.
