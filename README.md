The Huntington Library's archive contains the official correspondence of Pierre de Rigaud Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal, the governor of French Louisiana from 1742-1755.  Some of these letters are encoded in Le Grand Chiffre (The Great Cipher).  The cipher code was also found within the boxes.  The cipher contains over 500 coded words and vowel/consonant syllable combinations in this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygraphic_substitution">polygraphic substitution cipher</a>.  This project was created to facilitate the decoding of the Governor's letters in an effort to find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_de_Cavagnial" target="_blank">Fort Cavagnal (or Fort la Trinite)</a>.
