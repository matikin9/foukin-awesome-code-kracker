The Huntington Library's archive contains boxes of letters from a governor of French Louisiana, Pierre de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal.  Some of these letters are encoded.  The cipher was also found within the boxes.  The cipher contains over 300 coded words and vowel/consonant syllable combinations in this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygraphic_substitution">polygraphic substitution cipher</a>.  This project was created to facilitate the decoding of the governor's letters.
